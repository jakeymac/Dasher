# Overview

 I created this program to learn about how to use pygame to develop simple games in python.


This game is a simple game where the user has to avoid obstacles coming at them from the right of the screen for as long as possible. Using the up arrow key, the user can jump to avoid spikes on the ground, while there will also be spikes above as well. 

This game was made to learn about pygame and to create a simple game that is enjoyable and fun to look at.
